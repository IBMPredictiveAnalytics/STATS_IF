STATS IF Extension Command
==========================

Conditionally execute a block of code which may includes procedures.

STATS IF  
CONDITION1="*Python expression*" CONDITION2="*Python expression*"
... CONDITION5="*Python expression*"  
IMPORTS=*Python modules to import*  

/ERROR
CONTINUE=YES or NO^&#42;&#42;  
PRINT="*text*"  
ERRORCALL="*Python function*" 

/PRINT 
ATSTART="*text*" ATEND="*text*"  
/SYNTAX1 "*SPSS code*" "*SPSS code*" ...

/SYNTAX2 "*SPSS code*" ...  
...
/SYNTAX5 "*SPSS code*"...

^&#42; Required  
^&#42;&#42; Default

/HELP displays this help and does nothing else.

Example:
```
STATS CONDITION1="spss.GetCaseCount() > 10" CONDITION2="True"
/SYNTAX1 "FREQ x y z." "DESC a b c"
/SYNTAX2 "FREQ ALL".
```

The built-in conditional commands in Statistics such as DOIF only
apply to transformation code.  This extension command allows procedures
to be executed conditionally. 
The variables in the conditions refer to Python variables, not the SPSS
data.  The variables could be defined in a previous program block or 
via apis.  For example, you could write
`CONDITION1="spss.GetCaseCount() > 100"`

At least one CONDITION and a matching SYNTAX subcommand must be specified.

**CONDITION1** to **CONDITION5** define up to five Python expressions.
The first one that is true (if any) causes the SYNTAX subcommand
with the matching number to be executed.  The conditions are evaluated
in numerical order, so, for example, CONDITION1, if present, is always
evaluated first.  

The conditions must be quoted and follow SPSS
standard syntax quoting rules, which will be resolved before the
expression is evaluated by Python.  It may be convenient to use
INSERT commands here.  At most one block will be executed.
It is not an error if no block is selected.  The block numbers
present need not be consecutive.  To guarantee that at least one 
block is executed, you could write,
say, `CONDITION5="True"`.

**IMPORT** can specify one or more Python modules to be imported before
evaluating conditions or executing the syntax block.  The spss module
is imported automatically.

SYNTAX Subcommands
------------------
**SYNTAX1...SYNTAX5** specify one or more SPSS commands to be executed.
Each line of the syntax must be enclosed in single or double quotes.
The quoting must follow SPSS standard syntax quoting rules.
BEGIN PROGRAM/END PROGRAM and BEGIN/END DATA blocks cannot be used in 
these syntax blocks.  DEFINE...!ENDDEFINE can be used, which
offers some interesting ways to combine programmability and
macro.

ERROR
-----
ERROR specifies how SPSS syntax errors affect processing.
**CONTINUE**=NO, which is the default, causes the syntax block
to be terminated on any error of severity 3 or higher while
CONTINUE=YES causes syntax processing to resume with the
next command in the syntax block.  Since an INSERT command
as a syntax block is a single command, CONTINUE operates
only at the level of the INSERT.

**ERRORCALL** can specify a Python function to be invoked when
an error occurs.  See details below.

**PRINT**="text" causes the text to be printed if an error occurs.

PRINT
-----
**ATSTART** and **ATEND** can specify
text to be printed at the start and end of the block selected
by the condition.

ATSTART, ATEND, and /ERROR PRINT scan the text for the string
`)BLOCK` and replace it with the number of the block selected
for execution.  BLOCK must be written in upper case.

More on Error Handling
----------------------

An error handling function can be specified in the form
`"module.function"` or as `"function"`.  If the latter, it must
have been defined in a previously executed BEGIN PROGRAM block
or be a built-in Python function.
If a module name is specified, the command will attempt to import
the function.

If an error occurs, the function will be called.  It receives four
parameters: 
* the  block number (starting from 1), 
* the actual command syntax where the error occurred, 
* the error severity level (which is not always informative), and 
* the error description.  

If the function returns the string `"stop"` the block is not resumed.  
If it returns `"continue"`, processing resumes with the command 
following the error in the block being executed. 
With any other return value, including None, the action specified
in CONTINUE is taken.

Here is an example using an error handling function.
```
begin program.
def fixup(block, cmd, level, description):
    print "block:", block, "cmd:", cmd, "level:", level
    print "description:", description
    return "continue"
end program.

stats if condition1="True"
/error continue=no print="***** An error occurred" errorcall="fixup"
/syntax1 "freq jobcat."
"freq educ."
"freq foo."
"freq minority".
```
